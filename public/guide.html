  <h1 class="App-header">Spaced Repetition</h1>
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Spaced Repetition is a flashcard review web app based on the technique of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">Spaced Repetition</a>, a scientifically proven method to memorize information. Use it to memorize everything from vocabulary
    to equations to historical dates!</p>
  <p>All the flashcard information is stored in the cloud, so you can review your flashcards wherever and whenever you have
    internet.
  </p>
  <h1>Usage</h1>
  <p>First things first, sign in with Google.</p>
  <p>To create your first "deck" of flashcards, click on "New Deck", type in the deck name, and hit enter. The deck starts with
    a single placeholder card: press "View Deck" to create more (you can edit flashcards by clicking on them). </p>
  <p>Once you have created the flashcards you want, click "Study" to start studying them. I recommend trying to study each deck
    once per day: ideally, make it a routine!</p>
